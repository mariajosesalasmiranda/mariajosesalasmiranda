## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my profile
Hey there, I'm @mariajosesalasmiranda! Let me give you a glimpse into who I am: 

- **AI Master's Student & ASML Intern** \
I'm currently pursuing my master's degree in Artificial Intelligence (AI) at IULM University in Italy. Simultaneously, I'm interning at ASML in the Netherlands, contributing to the Strategic Sourcing & Procurement (SS&P) department within the Product Life Cycle Management (PLM) team.

I'm deeply fascinated by the potential of AI to transform our world and enhance various industries. My interests span across machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and the ethical implications of AI.

Born in Peru and raised in Italy, I thrive in multicultural settings. I've completed two Erasmus exchanges in Slovenia and Romania, which enhanced my adaptability and deepened my appreciation for diverse perspectives. I'm bilingual in Italian and Spanish, fluent in English, and have basic knowledge of French.

- **Continuous Learner** \
My academic journey has taken me from law to AI and now supply chain management, equipping me with a multidisciplinary approach to problem-solving and innovation. I'm constantly seeking new knowledge and skills to broaden my horizons, and I enjoy tackling challenges head-on.
